\begin{frame}{Motivation}
Mixed models can be used in practice to deal with disordered data and allow us to use all of our data. Indeed, we can have different grouping factors but also small sample sizes. So, mixed models can process the data even when we have small sample sizes, structured data, and many covariates to fit.
