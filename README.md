# Organization

## For the beamer

We decided to separate the beamer into 3 parts :
- Fanchon will do the end of the previous CM and the first part of our CM,
- Cassandre will do the middle part corresponding to the matrix model,
- Cherif will do the last part of it.

## For the two applications

- Cherif worked on the cheese data
- Fanchon and Cassandre worked on the politeness data
